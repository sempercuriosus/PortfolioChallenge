Challenge is to create a website such that potential employers are able to look at what I have done.

## User Story

```
AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
```

## Design

    - What I am thinking here is having an aside, on the left, that contains information about me and to the right of that, when available space is big enough, display contact information.
    - Under that, show projects organized left to right.

## Resources

    - AI Generated Cover Art [https://pixlr.com/x/#editor]
    - https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_images.asp
    - https://www.w3schools.com/css/tryit.asp?filename=trycss_css_image_overlay_slideleft
    - https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/flexbox-the-ultimate-css-flex-cheatsheet/
    - https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/
    - I also have used the AI for the class to help me work through some of the aspects of properties after I was stuck and had genuinely tried to figure it out myself.

## Challenges

This is my first go at getting things together on my own, and I am really enjoying the process. Here are some issues I had that I worked through:

        - Getting Flexbox to work
        - Adding a hover overlay that slides in from a specific direction
        - Refreshing what I know about style
