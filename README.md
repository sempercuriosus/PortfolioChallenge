# Class Project Create Portfolio

---

Challenge is to create a website such that potential employers are able to look at what I have done.

## User Story

```
AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
```

## Design

    - What I am thinking here is having an aside, on the left, that contains information about me and to the right of that, when available space is big enough, display contact information.
    - Under that, show projects organized left to right.
